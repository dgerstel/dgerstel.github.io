I was just awarded a PhD in particle physics. For the thesis, I performed a challenging data analysis testing "Lepton Flavour Universality"
at the LHCb experiment at CERN. My major responsibilities required the following skills: 
- Python and Shell (Bash) programming
- Machine Learning (Boosted Decision Trees, XGBoost)
- Computing on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)
- Ensuring reproducibility: pipeline automation (Snakemake), Continuous Integration (CI) with GitLab
- Communication: technical writing (thesis), presenting results on behalf of the LHCb Collaboration counting +1200 people 

I also taught Python and Java at university.

After the thesis, I decided to pursue a career in data science in business/industry.
I'll document in this blog my data science projects and practical lessons I've learnt in the field.

Feel free to get in touch if you spot a bug/mistake, have suggestions or want to tell me a joke ;-)
